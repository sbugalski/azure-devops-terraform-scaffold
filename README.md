# Azure DevOps Pipelines Terraform Scaffold ðŸš€

This repository helps you to get started with Terraform on Azure using Azure Pipelines in proper way!

Feel free to clone or [use as template](https://github.com/sbugalski/azure-devops-terraform-scaffold/generate)

## Requirements

To run the scaffold you need:

- Azure subscription
- Azure DevOps organization and (empty) project
- Git client and IDE will be useful ;)

## How To?

I tried to make it as simple as possible to _properly_ run Terraform in Azure DevOps YAML pipeline.

1. Clone / Import the repo (preferably Azure Repos)
1. Setup Service connections to Azure Resource Manager using service principal authentication

1. Setup variables
1. (optional) add your Terraform files
1. Run

### Pipeline variables
